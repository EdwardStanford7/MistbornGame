This is just a personal project of me attempting to make a metroidvania game off of allomancy from Brandon Sanderson's mistborn series.

Basic premise of the game is player will start out as a lurcher probably and then will gradually gain other abilites through Hemalurgy. Maybe this is set during the Lord Ruler's empire and this is an Obligator trying turn themselves into an inquisitor or something.

Ideas/TODOS

Copper/Bronze: Bronze maybe some sort of tracking system like the scent trails in twilight princess Copper idk except maybe a certain enemy type that can track when you use metals or something who knows. Some sort of stealth mechanic/section?

Cadmium not sure, might scrap. One of the benefits of basing this game off of hemalurgy is that useless powers don't have to be included because why would someone seek out a useless power.

Gold/Electrum: Gold for lore exposition dumps? Some sort of amnesia game and gold shows you things that you did in the past? Electrum just make you immune to Atium burning enemies (I think maybe you have input lag when fighting an Atium enemy/boss).

Chromium/Nicrosil: Chromium maybe could do something with temporarily inhibiting an allomantic enemy, Nicrosil probably only makes sense in multiplayer setting.

Aluminum/Duralumin: Aluminum is implemented because Duralumin needs the same  functionality but probably will end up scrapping it. Duralumin enhance your powers for a certain time and then wipe your abilities.

Atium: Give enemies "input lag"
