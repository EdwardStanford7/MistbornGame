This is just a personal project of me attempting to make a metroidvania game off of allomancy from Brandon Sanderson's mistborn series.

Basic premise of the game is player will start out as a lurcher probably and then will gradually gain other abilites through Hemalurgy. Maybe this is set during the Lord Ruler's empire and this is an Obligator trying turn themselves into an inquisitor or something. Maybe the story of Kar or something? Might not work with the idea of getting abilities from Nobles. Maybe could be some sort of thing where Kar is trying to prove his worth the Lord Ruler and is eliminating Skaa sympathetic or traitorous nobles.

Probably get abilities from nobles of each house. Game map is the City of Luthadel and each keep is a "dungeon" where you get a new ability from the boss who would be a nobleman of the house.

Houses: Venture, Hasting, Eraliel, Tekiel, Lekal, Erikeller, Erikell, Haught, Urbain, Buvidas. 

14 abilities: Steel, Tin, Pewter, Zinc, Brass, Copper, Bronze, Bendalloy (if using), Gold, Electrum, Atium, Chromium, Duralumin, Atium.

Only 10 houses so need to storyboard some more for that.

TODOS

Copper/Bronze: Bronze maybe some sort of tracking system like the scent trails in twilight princess Copper idk except maybe a certain enemy type that can track when you use metals or something who knows. Some sort of stealth mechanic/section?

Does it make sense to have Bendalloy? It's a cool ability but canonically they didn't know about it during the Final Empire.

Gold/Electrum: Gold for lore exposition dumps? Some sort of amnesia game and gold shows you things that you did in the past? Electrum just make you immune to Atium burning enemies (I think maybe you have input lag when fighting an Atium enemy/boss).

Chromium: Chromium maybe could do something with temporarily inhibiting an allomantic enemy.

Aluminum/Duralumin: Aluminum functionality is implemented by proxy from Duralumin functionality but probably won't be an actual ability. Duralumin enhance your powers for a certain time and then wipe your abilities.

Atium: Give enemies "input lag"
