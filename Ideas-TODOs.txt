Overhaul physics

Ceiling hang bug if still there once physics done

Copper/Bronze: Bronze maybe some sort of tracking system like the scent trails in twilight princess Copper idk except maybe a certain enemy type that can track when you use metals or something who knows.

Cadmium/Bendalloy: Cadmium not sure, Bendalloy freeze enemies around you for certain ammount of time (have to decide whether to do a bubble effect).

Gold/Electrum: Gold for lore exposition dumps? Some sort of amnesia game and gold shows you things that you did in the past? Electrum just make you immune to Atium burning enemies (I think maybe you have input lag when fighting an Atium enemy/boss).

Chromium/Nicrosil: Chromium maybe could do something with temporarily inhibiting an allomantic enemy, Nicrosil probably only makes sense in multiplayer setting.

Aluminum/Duralumin: Alluminum accidentally buring could wipe your abilities (just temporarily inhibit powers), Duralumin enhance your powers for a certain time and then wipe your abilities.

Atium: Give enemies "input lag".
